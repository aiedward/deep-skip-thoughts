# deep-skip-thoughts

This is a brutal Torch implementation of [Skip-Thought Vectors](http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.06726). The original implementation is at [here](https://github.com/ryankiros/skip-thoughts). You may read the paper for more details.

Recently I found Tensorflow and MXNet is far more interesting than Torch. I may use MXNet to rewrite this project and the old version will not update anymore. But you can try it in the `old` dir.
